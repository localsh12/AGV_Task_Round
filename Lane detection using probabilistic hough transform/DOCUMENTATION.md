# Lane detection using probabolistic hough transform
For theory I have refered to udacity course  https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud810 <br />
-first, I took the input image and used the canny edge detector <br />- I used masking to gain ROI 
  <br />-then, I used the hough line detection method to detect the line 
  <br />- finally, I averaged out the line and then displayed the output
